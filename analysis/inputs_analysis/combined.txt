# description of POSIX counters:
#   POSIX_*: posix operation counts.
#   READS,WRITES,OPENS,SEEKS,STATS,MMAPS,SYNCS,FILENOS,DUPS are types of operations.
#   POSIX_RENAME_SOURCES/TARGETS: total count file was source or target of a rename operation
#   POSIX_RENAMED_FROM: Darshan record ID of the first rename source, if file was a rename target
#   POSIX_MODE: mode that file was opened in.
#   POSIX_BYTES_*: total bytes read and written.
#   POSIX_MAX_BYTE_*: highest offset byte read and written.
#   POSIX_CONSEC_*: number of exactly adjacent reads and writes.
#   POSIX_SEQ_*: number of reads and writes from increasing offsets.
#   POSIX_RW_SWITCHES: number of times access alternated between read and write.
#   POSIX_*_ALIGNMENT: memory and file alignment.
#   POSIX_*_NOT_ALIGNED: number of reads and writes that were not aligned.
#   POSIX_MAX_*_TIME_SIZE: size of the slowest read and write operations.
#   POSIX_SIZE_*_*: histogram of read and write access sizes.
#   POSIX_STRIDE*_STRIDE: the four most common strides detected.
#   POSIX_STRIDE*_COUNT: count of the four most common strides.
#   POSIX_ACCESS*_ACCESS: the four most common access sizes.
#   POSIX_ACCESS*_COUNT: count of the four most common access sizes.
#   POSIX_*_RANK: rank of the processes that were the fastest and slowest at I/O (for shared files).
#   POSIX_*_RANK_BYTES: bytes transferred by the fastest and slowest ranks (for shared files).
#   POSIX_F_*_START_TIMESTAMP: timestamp of first open/read/write/close.
#   POSIX_F_*_END_TIMESTAMP: timestamp of last open/read/write/close.
#   POSIX_F_READ/WRITE/META_TIME: cumulative time spent in read, write, or metadata operations.
#   POSIX_F_MAX_*_TIME: duration of the slowest read and write operations.
#   POSIX_F_*_RANK_TIME: fastest and slowest I/O time for a single rank (for shared files).
#   POSIX_F_VARIANCE_RANK_*: variance of total I/O time and bytes moved for all ranks (for shared files).

# WARNING: POSIX_OPENS counter includes both POSIX_FILENOS and POSIX_DUPS counts

# WARNING: POSIX counters related to file offsets may be incorrect if a file is simultaneously accessed by both POSIX and STDIO (e.g., using fileno())
# 	- Affected counters include: MAX_BYTE_{READ|WRITTEN}, CONSEC_{READS|WRITES}, SEQ_{READS|WRITES}, {MEM|FILE}_NOT_ALIGNED, STRIDE*_STRIDE
